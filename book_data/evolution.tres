But some lineages have adapted to this to have less protections that stop mutations that allow for a greater rate of mutation, some have even evolved the ability to change their DNA during their lifetime.

We believe three weeks should be enough time to remove it and hide the evidence in the basement until transport can be arranged for permanent removal. We will bring in Dr. Furley in the meantime to identify the mass as well.

But as I have been studying the dissected parts I've noticed signs that the tissue is still mutating and growing. I will keep a section to study and test even after the majority of it is removed, who knows this could be a breakthrough in evolutionary biology as we know it.
